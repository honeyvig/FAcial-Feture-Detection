# FAcial-Feture-Detection
Creating a Python PyQt5 application that can take a picture from the camera, scan and analyze it for facial features, and then convert it into an X-ray, EEG, ECG, or MRI image is a complex task. This would require combining multiple technologies, such as computer vision (for facial recognition), machine learning (for feature classification), and image processing libraries.

While the full feature set you've requested involves advanced medical imaging and AI models (which go beyond the scope of a simple Python app), I can guide you on how to build a base app using PyQt5, OpenCV, and other libraries to achieve basic facial feature detection and basic image manipulation.

We'll use:

    OpenCV: For capturing the image and processing facial features.
    Dlib or Haar Cascades: For facial feature detection (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth).
    PyQt5: For creating the GUI to interact with the user.
    Pillow (PIL): For image processing and manipulation.
    NumPy: For numerical operations, e.g., image transformations.

The full task requires deep learning models for specific medical image generation (like X-ray or EEG), but I'll focus on how to capture facial features and offer basic transformations.

Here's a base example to get you started:
1. Install required libraries:

First, you'll need to install some dependencies. You can install them via pip:

pip install pyqt5 opencv-python dlib pillow numpy

2. Basic PyQt App with Facial Feature Detection:

import sys
import cv2
import numpy as np
import dlib
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget, QVBoxLayout, QPushButton, QLabel, QFileDialog, QComboBox
from PyQt5.QtGui import QImage, QPixmap
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt, QTimer
from PIL import Image

class FacialAnalysisApp(QWidget):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Initialize dlib face detector and shape predictor
        self.detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
        self.predictor = dlib.shape_predictor("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat")  # You need to download this model

        self.initUI()

    def initUI(self):
        layout = QVBoxLayout()

        # Create button for capturing photo from the camera
        self.capture_btn = QPushButton('Capture Photo', self)
        self.capture_btn.clicked.connect(self.capture_image)
        layout.addWidget(self.capture_btn)

        # Create combo box for feature analysis options (e.g., X-ray, ECG, etc.)
        self.analysis_combo = QComboBox(self)
        self.analysis_combo.addItem("Normal View")
        self.analysis_combo.addItem("X-Ray View")
        self.analysis_combo.addItem("MRI View")
        self.analysis_combo.currentIndexChanged.connect(self.apply_transformation)
        layout.addWidget(self.analysis_combo)

        # Label to display the image
        self.image_label = QLabel(self)
        layout.addWidget(self.image_label)

        # Set the layout
        self.setLayout(layout)
        self.setWindowTitle('Facial Feature Analysis')
        self.setGeometry(100, 100, 800, 600)

        self.captured_image = None
        self.show()

    def capture_image(self):
        # Open the webcam and capture the image
        cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 for the default webcam
        if not cap.isOpened():
            print("Error: Cannot access camera.")
            return

        ret, frame = cap.read()
        cap.release()

        if ret:
            self.captured_image = frame
            self.detect_features(frame)
            self.update_image(frame)

    def detect_features(self, frame):
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        faces = self.detector(gray)

        for face in faces:
            landmarks = self.predictor(gray, face)

            # Draw landmarks for facial features
            for n in range(36, 48):  # Eyes
                x, y = landmarks.part(n).x, landmarks.part(n).y
                cv2.circle(frame, (x, y), 2, (0, 255, 0), -1)

            for n in range(48, 60):  # Mouth
                x, y = landmarks.part(n).x, landmarks.part(n).y
                cv2.circle(frame, (x, y), 2, (255, 0, 0), -1)

            # Nose (nose tip)
            nose = landmarks.part(30)
            cv2.circle(frame, (nose.x, nose.y), 3, (255, 255, 0), -1)

            # Draw bounding box around face
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (face.left(), face.top()), (face.right(), face.bottom()), (0, 0, 255), 2)

    def update_image(self, frame):
        # Convert image for display in PyQt
        height, width, channel = frame.shape
        bytes_per_line = 3 * width
        img = QImage(frame.data, width, height, bytes_per_line, QImage.Format_RGB888).rgbSwapped()
        pixmap = QPixmap.fromImage(img)
        self.image_label.setPixmap(pixmap)

    def apply_transformation(self):
        if self.captured_image is None:
            return

        # Apply the selected transformation (e.g., X-ray, MRI, etc.)
        transformation_type = self.analysis_combo.currentText()
        transformed_image = self.captured_image.copy()

        if transformation_type == "X-Ray View":
            transformed_image = self.apply_xray(transformed_image)
        elif transformation_type == "MRI View":
            transformed_image = self.apply_mri(transformed_image)

        self.update_image(transformed_image)

    def apply_xray(self, image):
        # Apply an X-ray-like filter (just an example using image manipulation)
        gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        _, xray_image = cv2.threshold(gray_image, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
        return cv2.cvtColor(xray_image, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR)

    def apply_mri(self, image):
        # Apply an MRI-like effect (using simple blurring to simulate the concept)
        return cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (15, 15), 0)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    ex = FacialAnalysisApp()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())

Explanation of the Code:

    Capture Image: This application uses the OpenCV library to capture an image from the computerâ€™s webcam.

    Facial Feature Detection: Using dlib's pre-trained face detection and shape predictor models (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat), the app detects key facial features like eyes, nose, mouth, and face shape. You can download the model from dlib's GitHub repository.

    Image Transformation: The app allows the user to select different transformations (e.g., X-ray, MRI). These transformations are applied using simple image manipulation techniques like thresholding for X-ray simulation and Gaussian blurring for MRI-like effects.

    PyQt GUI: The GUI allows the user to interact with the application by capturing an image, selecting analysis options, and viewing the transformed results.

What You Need to Improve:

    Medical Imaging (EEG, ECG): Converting a photo into EEG, ECG, or similar medical images involves advanced deep learning models and cannot be done with basic image manipulation techniques. For medical image synthesis, you'd need to research AI models like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) trained on medical datasets, and this is a very complex task.

    Model for Nose Shape, Lips, and Ear Classification: You would need a dataset and a machine learning model to classify the nose shape, ear shape, or lips.

    Privacy Considerations: If you're collecting and processing personal data like images, be sure to implement security and privacy measures. For production apps, user consent is essential, and you must comply with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).

    Real Medical Application: For real medical applications, you need certified medical devices or deep learning models that can produce medically accurate results, along with regulatory approvals.

Conclusion:

The above code sets up a basic facial feature detection app using PyQt5, OpenCV, and dlib. The transformations (like X-ray and MRI) are simulated using image manipulation techniques. However, for actual medical image conversion or more advanced feature classification (like specific body shape analysis), you'd need deep learning models and potentially access to medical datasets.
